Aguinaldo, amd of course, his most enlightened lover, Remedios Nable Jose. However, some are presuming that Remedios's sister, Dolores Nable Jose wa actually the general's real last love<br>

of Capitan Isidro Wenceslao that Gregorio had Dolores in his mind in their last meeting with Aguinaldo. However, majority of the people believes that Remedios is truly his lover, providing <br>
their evidence of Gregorio's last letter to Remedios with endearing words written by the gentleman. Yet despite all of these, the beloved general's love life still remains a mystery wether it <br>

Another reason why people wouldn't accept Dolores as Gregorio's lover is because of the stories they heard that is shared between the General and binibing Remedios. In this very popular <br>
love story of theirs, Binibining Remedios had rejected the young man due to his reputation of being a playboy. However, Heneral Goyo finally attracted the lady by his endearing charms <br>

attention to their story, It was said that Remedios never did marry and lived longly to able to see the country get exposed to advancements in technology. As for Dolores's case, after <br>
Gregorio's death, she seemed to have dissapeared from the records as there is no mention of her in the 1916 court case where her family members appeared, Could it be possible that Dolores <br>
is the general's last love and not Remedios?
